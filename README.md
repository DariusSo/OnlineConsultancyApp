[AdvisorFlow](https://advisorflow.dariussongaila.dev) is my final project for the Vilnius Coding School Java course. Its primary feature is connecting users with experts who can answer their questions through Chat and Video Chat. Additionally, it offers the ability to post questions and receive answers that are visible to everyone, fostering a shared knowledge base for the community.

## **Architecture**

### **Schema Diagram**
Below is the high-level architecture of the backend, showing how different components interact:

![Backend Schema](./imgread/backendSchema.png)

---

### **Purpose of Key Components**

1. **Controllers**:
   - Handle incoming HTTP requests and map them to the service layer.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Encapsulates business logic, connects to the repository layer, and integrates external APIs like ChatGPT and Stripe.

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - Interacts with the MySQL database using JPA.

4. **Redis**:
   - Used for caching frequently accessed data such as consultant profiles and availability.

5. **RabbitMQ**:
   - Used for handling asynchronous tasks like sending email notifications for appointments.

6. **Coturn**:
   - Provides TURN server functionality for WebRTC-based video calls.

7. **IMGBB**:
   - Used for managing and storing user-uploaded images, such as profile pictures.

8. **ChatGPT**:
   - Provides AI-driven consultation capabilities.

### **Dependencies**

Below is a list of key dependencies used in the backend and their purposes:

#### **Core Dependencies**
1. **Spring Boot**:
   - `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building RESTful web services.
   - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For database interactions with MySQL.
   - `spring-boot-starter-websocket`: For real-time WebSocket communication.
   - `spring-boot-starter-test`: For testing (JUnit, Mockito).

2. **Database**:
   - `mysql-connector-java`: MySQL driver for database connections.
   - `h2`: In-memory database for development and testing.

#### **Authentication**

## **Problems Left to Tackle**

Despite the progress made in developing AdvisorFlow, there are still some challenges and issues to address:

- **Scalability for Real-Time Communication**:  
  The current WebRTC setup with Coturn may face scalability issues as the number of simultaneous video calls increases. A distributed TURN server setup might be required.

- **Enhanced Error Handling**:  
  Improve error handling mechanisms across the backend and frontend to ensure better user experience and debugging capabilities.

- **Improved User Notifications**:  
  Notifications for appointment updates, cancellations, and other events are handled via RabbitMQ but lack in-app notifications. Adding a real-time notification system would improve user experience.

- **Frontend Performance Optimization**:  
  Optimize the React frontend for faster load times, especially for consultant searches and dashboard views with large datasets.

- **Tests**:  
  For now testing was minimal, made only to match specifict requirements for a final project.

- **Consultant Availability Management**:  
  Enhance the UI/UX for managing time slots, including bulk editing and setting recurring availability schedules.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**:  
  While the current design is functional, some pages require better responsiveness for mobile devices.

## **Future Possibilities**

- **Mobile Application**:  
  Build native mobile applications for iOS and Android to improve accessibility and user experience.

- **Multi-Language Support**:  
  Add multi-language support to the platform to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

- **Analytics Dashboard**:  
  Provide consultants with a dashboard to track their appointments, earnings, and client reviews.

- **In-App Notifications**:  
  Implement real-time, in-app notifications for updates on appointments, payments, and messages.

- **Recording Consultations**:  
  Add the ability for users and consultants to record video consultations, ensuring privacy and compliance with applicable laws.

- **AI Model Customization**:  
  Allow consultants to upload their own knowledge base or guidelines for a personalized AI assistant tailored to their expertise.

- **Integration with Calendar Services**:  
  Integrate with third-party calendars like Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook for better appointment management.

- **Custom Payment Options**:  
  Expand payment gateway options beyond Stripe to include PayPal, bank transfers, and other local payment methods.

- **Subscription Model**:  
  Introduce a subscription plan for users who want unlimited access to specific consultants or AI-powered consultations.

- **Enhanced Search Functionality**:  
  Add advanced filters and sorting options for finding consultants based on ratings, response times, and availability.

- **Consultant Reviews and Ratings**:  
  Allow clients to leave reviews and ratings for consultants to build credibility and trust within the platform.

- **Security Enhancements**:  
  Conduct regular security audits and implement features like 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for added protection.

- **Load Testing and Scaling**:  
  Perform load testing and deploy autoscaling infrastructure to ensure seamless performance during peak loads.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:  
  Automate deployment pipelines using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for faster updates and maintenance.
